# Copy Link With `favicon`

This is an extension of the "Copy URL Extension" by Ian Bicking, available here:
[https://github.com/ianb/copy-url-extension.git]

It copies the current URL, in HTML or markdown, and also adds the `favicon` to the beginning.

I (the author) is using this script to add links to my Joplin app, which I use as a centralized bookmark tool.
